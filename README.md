# MCPollinations Multimodal MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants to generate images, text, and audio through the Pollinations APIs

## Features

- Generate image URLs from text prompts
- Generate images and return them as base64-encoded data AND save as png, jpeg, jpg, or webp (default: png)
- Generate text responses from text prompts
- Generate audio responses from text prompts
- List available image and text generation models
- No authentication required
- Simple and lightweight
- Compatible with the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## System Requirements

- **Node.js**: Version 14.0.0 or higher
  - For best performance, we recommend Node.js 16.0.0 or higher
  - Node.js versions below 16 use an AbortController polyfill

## Quick Start

The easiest way to use the MCP server:

```bash
# Run directly with npx (no installation required)
npx @pinkpixel/mcpollinations
```

If you prefer to install it globally:

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @pinkpixel/mcpollinations

# Run the server
mcpollinations
# or
npx @pinkpixel/mcpollinations

```

Or clone the repository:

```bash
# Clone the git repository
git clone https://github.com/pinkpixel-dev/mcpollinations.git
# Run the server
mcpollinations
# or
npx @pinkpixel/mcpollinations
# or run directly
node /path/to/MCPollinations/pollinations-mcp-server.js

```

## MCP Integration

To integrate the server with applications that support the Model Context Protocol (MCP):

1. Generate an MCP configuration file:

```bash
# If installed globally
npx @pinkpixel/mcpollinations generate-config

# Or run directly
node /path/to/MCPollinations/generate-mcp-config.js
```

2. Follow the prompts to customize your configuration or use the defaults.
   - Set custom output and temporary directories (defaults to relative paths for portability)
   - Configure default parameters for image generation (with a list of available models, dimensions, etc.)
   - Configure default parameters for text generation (with a list of available models)
   - Configure default parameters for audio generation (voice)
   - Specify which tools should be allowed

3. Copy the generated `mcp.json` file to your application's MCP settings .json file.
4. Restart your application.

After integration, you can use commands like:

"Generate an image of a sunset over the ocean using MCPollinations"


## Troubleshooting

### "AbortController is not defined" Error

If you encounter this error when running the MCP server:

```
ReferenceError: AbortController is not defined
```

This is usually caused by running on an older version of Node.js (below version 16.0.0). Try one of these solutions:

1. **Update Node.js** (recommended):
   - Update to Node.js 16.0.0 or newer

2. **Use Global Installation**
   - Update to the latest version of the package:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @pinkpixel/mcpollinations
   # Run with npx
   npx @pinkpixel/mcpollinations
   ```

3. **Install AbortController manually**:
   - If for some reason the polyfill doesn't work:
   ```bash
   npm install node-abort-controller
   ```

### Check Your Node.js Version

To check your current Node.js version:

```bash
node --version
```

If it shows a version lower than 16.0.0, consider upgrading for best compatibility.

## Available Tools

The MCP server provides the following tools:

1. `generateImageUrl` - Generates an image URL from a text prompt
2. `generateImage` - Generates an image, returns it as base64-encoded data, and saves it to a file by default (PNG format)
3. `respondAudio` - Generates an audio response to a text prompt (customizable voice parameter)
4. `respondText` - Responds with text to a prompt using text models (customizable model parameter)
5. `listImageModels` - Lists available models for image generation
6. `listTextModels` - Lists available models for text generation
7. `listAudioVoices` - Lists all available voices for audio generation

## Image Generation Details

### Default Behavior

When using the `generateImage` tool:

- Images are saved to disk by default as PNG files
- The default save location is `~/mcpollinations-output` in the user's home directory 
**NOTE** It is recommended to set an absolute path to your desired image save location, due to limitations within some application environemnts.
- The 'flux' model is used by default
- A random seed is generated by default for each image (ensuring variety)
- Base64-encoded image data is always returned, regardless of whether the image is saved to a file

### Customizing Image Generation

```javascript
// Example options for generateImage
const options = {
  // Model selection (defaults to 'flux')
  model: "flux",

  // Image dimensions
  width: 1024,
  height: 1024,

  // Generation options
  seed: 12345,  // Specific seed for reproducibility (defaults to random)
  enhance: true,  // Enhance the prompt using an LLM before generating (defaults to true)
  safe: false,  // Content filtering (defaults to false)

  // File saving options
  saveToFile: true,  // Set to false to skip saving to disk
  outputPath: "/path/to/save/directory",  // Custom save location
  fileName: "my_custom_name",  // Without extension
  format: "png"  // png, jpeg, jpg, or webp
};
```

### Where Images Are Saved

When using Claude or another application with the MCP server:

1. **Images are saved in `~/mcpollinations-output` in your home directory by default**. This makes it easy to find your generated images regardless of where the MCP server is running from.

2. The tilde (~) is automatically expanded to your home directory path (e.g., `/home/username` on Linux, `/Users/username` on macOS, or `C:\Users\username` on Windows).

3. If Claude Desktop or another application launches the MCP server automatically, images will still be saved to this location in your home directory.

### Finding Your Generated Images

- The response from Claude after generating an image includes the full file path where the image was saved
- You can specify a familiar location using the `outputPath` parameter
- Best practice: Ask Claude to save images to an easily accessible folder like your Pictures or Downloads directory

### Important Note About Tool Behavior

- When using the MCP server directly (e.g., through an MCP client application), images will be saved to `~/mcpollinations-output` in your home directory
- When using the `generateImage_npx` tool directly in environments like VSCode extensions, images may be saved in the extension's directory instead
- For consistent behavior across all environments, specify an absolute path for the `outputPath` parameter, such as:
  - Linux/macOS: `/home/username/Pictures/mcpollinations`
  - Windows: `C:\Users\username\Pictures\mcpollinations`

### Unique Filenames

The MCP server ensures that generated images always have unique filenames and will never overwrite existing files:

1. **Default filenames** include:
   - A sanitized version of the prompt (first 20 characters)
   - A timestamp
   - A random suffix

2. **Custom filenames** are also protected:
   - If you specify a filename and a file with that name already exists, a numeric suffix will be added automatically
   - For example: `sunset.png`, `sunset_1.png`, `sunset_2.png`, etc.

This means you can safely generate multiple images with the same prompt or filename without worrying about overwriting previous images.

### Accessing Base64 Data

Even when saving to a file, the base64-encoded image data is always returned and can be used for:

- Embedding in web pages (`<img src="data:image/png;base64,..." />`)
- Passing to other services or APIs
- Processing in memory without filesystem operations
- Displaying in applications that support data URIs

## For Developers

If you want to use the package in your own projects:

```bash
# Install as a dependency
npm install @pinkpixel/mcpollinations

# Import in your code
import { generateImageUrl, generateImage, repsondText, respondAudio, listTextModels, listImageModels, listAudioVoices } from '@pinkpixel/mcpollinations';
```
